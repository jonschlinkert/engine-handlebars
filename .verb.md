## Heads up!

There were major [breaking changes in v1.0!](#release-history).

## Usage

```js
const handlebars = require('handlebars');
const engine = require('{%= name %}')(handlebars);
console.log(engine);
```

The `engine` object that is returned has the following properties:

- `name` - the name of the engine: `handlebars`, used for engine detection in other libraries.
- `instance` - your instance of handlebars
- `compile` - async compile method
- `compileSync` - sync compile method
- `render` -  async render method
- `renderSync` - sync render method
